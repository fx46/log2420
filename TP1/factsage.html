<h1> FACT-Format Output </h1>

<p> Let us examine the results for the following molar reaction at 1 atm and 298.15 K: </p>

<p id="formule"> Mg    +    3 Cu2O  +   2 Fe3C    =   ? </p>

<p> Complete equilibrium is assumed (i.e. kinetics are ignored). In <B>Equilib-Web</B>, 
the possible equilibrium products are an ideal gas phase, pure solids and pure liquids. 
In the <strong><font color="33CC33"> Equilib </font> </strong> module of the full <img src="images/logo.jpg" width="90" height="30" align="absmiddle"> package, charged species (aqueous and gaseous ions), 
non-ideal solution data and additional databases can also be included. </p>

<p> The FACT-Format prints the computed equilibrium composition of the gas phase followed
by all possible product solids and liquids, ordered with respect to activity. Even if the 
gas phase is not stable (as in the current example), the output still yields equilibrium 
potentials of the gaseous species. </p>

<p>From the Gibbs phase rule, F = C - P +2, F is degrees of freedom, C is the number of 
components, and P is the number of phases. In <B>Equilib-Web</B> the product T and P are 
constrained (i.e. F = 2). In the present example there are 5 elements (Mg, Cu, O, Fe and 
C) and so from the phase rule there will be up to 5 stable product phases. </p>
