		<p> Let us examine the results for the following molar reaction at 1 atm and 298.15 K: </p>

		<p id="formule"><b> Mg    +    3 Cu2O  +   2 Fe3C    =   ? </b></p>

		<p> Complete equilibrium is assumed (i.e. kinetics are ignored). In <B>Equilib-Web</B>, 
		the possible equilibrium products are an ideal gas phase, pure solids and pure liquids. 
		In the <strong><font color="E99619"> Equilib </font> </strong> module of the full <img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="Logo de FactSage" width="90" height="30" align="absmiddle"> package, charged species (aqueous and gaseous ions), 
		non-ideal solution data and additional databases can also be included. </p>

		<hr noshade>

		<p> The FACT-Format prints the computed equilibrium composition of the gas phase followed
		by all possible product solids and liquids, ordered with respect to activity. Even if the 
		gas phase is not stable (as in the current example), the output still yields equilibrium 
		potentials of the gaseous species. </p>

		<p>From the Gibbs phase rule, F = C - P +2, F is degrees of freedom, C is the number of 
		components, and P is the number of phases. In <B>Equilib-Web</B> the product T and P are 
		constrained (i.e. F = 2). In the present example there are 5 elements (Mg, Cu, O, Fe and 
		C) and so from the phase rule there will be up to 5 stable product phases. </p>

		<p>The equilibrium products - Cu, Fe, C, MgO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> - satisfy the mass balance. The gas phase is treated as ideal ('gas_ideal'). The results show the sum of the gas partial pressures is 0.21821e-19 atm. Since the total pressure is 1 atm, the gas phase is not stable. </p>

Compressibilities of the condensed phases also may be included in the computation. </p>
